--- NETWORKING - mgmt and prod
--- TIDYUP RAKEFILE (moved to acceptest)

* Rename logfiles to use VM name instead of incremental number.  e.g. console-puppetmaster.log instead of console-0.log
* Allow overriding disk size per template, e.g. puppetmaster needs to be >3
* Fix puppetdb installation to not be done in rc.local
* Trap ^C and cleanup correctly.

* SPEED UP
	-> rake target for local cache creation
	-> caching of apt?

* KERNEL IS HARDCODED

* PARAMETERIZE puppetmaster.conf
